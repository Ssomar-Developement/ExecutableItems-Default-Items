<h1>Repository of the ExecutableItems default items</h1>

We invite everyone to contribute and add cool new items & textures !<br>
Don't hesitate to make your promotion in the item lore.

<h2>Rules</h2>
> Your item must start with Prem if it only work with the Premium version and Free otherwise<br><br>
> Your item config file must end with the versions supported<br>
&nbsp; Example:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Prem_my_item_v1_8  (It means that your items work from 1.8 to lastest version)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Prem_my_item_v1_12_2__1_16  (It means that your items work from 1.12.2 to 1.16)<br><br><br>
> If you want to add textures, place your textures in the folder __textures__ and only use rabbit_foot as item material.<br>
&nbsp;Since the 1.20.5 every plugn can add its own textures packs but if two plugin modify the same item, the textures pack doesn't load. To be sure EI pack loads I decided to use an item that is most likely not customized. We have the monopoly on the rabbit_foot, yeahhh !<br>
